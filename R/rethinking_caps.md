# Rethinking caps

Keeping track of all the capitalized words. Oh, the jargon.

* OVERFITTING: Using too many variables to explain a given response and solve a regression problem, so much so that the estimates from the regression are intimately tailored to the data used to estimate them and do not generalize well outside of this data.

* EXPONENTIAL FAMILY: Normal, Binomial, Poisson distributions are members of this family.
  * Maximum entropy distribution: Of all the continuous distributions with a fixed variance, the normal distribution has the highest entropy (non-uniformity).
