# Rethinking concepts

Concepts for recapitulating

* Regularizing or weakly informative priors --> Penalized likelihood
* A "subjective Bayesian"
* Choosing priors --> Choosing estimators,likelihood penalties and loss functions
* Combinations of data, likelihood, parameters and priors determine the estimates of the posterior distribution
* Expectation of data over the prior is called the marginal likelihood
