Hypotheses --> Process models --> Statistical models

Several process models can operationalize vague hypotheses.
Statistical models to challenge process models with evidence
by deriving the expected frequency distribution of some quantity
called a "statistic" in the model.

The null model is not unique to any process model nor hypothesis.

The EXPONENTIAL FAMILY of distributions include the normal, binomial,
Poisson etc. and are MAXIMUM ENTROPY distributions.

Bayesian Philosophy
Parameters and models cannot have probability distributions, only measurements can.
Sampling distribution of any measurement is constant because the measurement is deterministic.
Randomness is a property of information and not of the world.

Laplace-Jeffreys-Cox-Jaynes: "logical" Cox interpretation of Bayesian probability

Statistical models stand upon parameters. It's parameters all the way down.
Model with multiple levels of uncertainty - each feeding into the next is a multilevel model.
To adjust estimates for repeat sampling, imbalance in sampling, study variation and avoid
averaging across individuals, groups, locations, times. Even well-controlled treatments
interact with unmeasured aspects of individuals, groups, or populations studied - this
leads to variation in treatment effects. Multilevel modeling quantifies the extent of this
variation, as well as identify which units in the data responded in which ways.

Metrics for comparing structurally different models: INFORMATION CRITERIA
Compare models based upon future predictive accuracy.

#### Bayesian Inference

* Count and compare possibilities
* Consider everything that could have happened and retain what is logically consistent with knowledge
* Maximally conservative and quantitative ranking of hypotheses, given assumptions and data.
